# ELEC391_25W2

### By Colin Yeung, Chathil Rajamanthree, Ethan Soon, Rishi Singh, Rohan Friar and Suryansh Madaan


## Course Activities
The course has 2 activities, each allocated approximately 6 weeks to complete.
1. Sub-System Design (teams of 1 or 2)
2. System Integration (teams of 5 or 6)

<u>Sub-System Design</u>

Each sub-system design team is responsible for 1 sub-system.
1. Software

    i. PID controller running on micro-controller
    
    ii. Matlab model of electro-mechanical system

    iii. MBK stub

2. Circuits

    i. All electronics integrated onto PCB daughter-board

    ii. Micro-controller based driver
    
    iii. Passive RLC load stub

3. Hardware

    i. Physical mechanism

    ii. Custom actuator

    iii. Micro-controller based driver


Design work is presented in a live demonstration. Mandatory drivers & stubs must be developed to show
proof-of-concept functionality of all sub-systems.


<u> System Integration </u>

The system integration team collaborates to integrate all sub-systems into a working prototype.
Integration details are presented in a live demonstration.

---

<u>System Design</u>

The quality of the system design is based on:
- Technical requirements & constraints (input formulation)
- Steps taken to satisfy stated requirements
- Proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate results

<u>System Integration</u>

The quality of the system integration is based on:
- Satisfaction of technical requirements
- Design content
- Implementation quality & reliability
- Extra features (goals)
