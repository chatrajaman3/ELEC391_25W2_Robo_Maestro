Testing program for the motor and encoder:
- currently reads encoder using timer 2 and converts to the angle of output shaft
- need to implement something to read velocity (will need to use another timer)
- need to implement a filter 
- need to find a way to set an origin point

Wiring:
red -> CW signal
black -> 5V
yellow -> PA1
green -> PA0
blue -> microcontroller ground
white -> CCW signal
